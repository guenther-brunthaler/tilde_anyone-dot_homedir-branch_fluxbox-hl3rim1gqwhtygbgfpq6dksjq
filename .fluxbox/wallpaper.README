Copy $MYWALLPAPER.jpg to *this* directory.

Choose a wallpaper setter utility (which is installed) from the list displayed 
by the following command:

$ echo && sed '/^case $WPSETTER in/,/^esac/!d;'`:\
	`'s/^[[:space:]]*\([-_[:alnum:]]\{1,\}\))$/\1/; t; d' \
	"`command -v fbsetbg`" | while read u; do \
	command -v -- "$u" > /dev/null 2>& 1 && echo $u \
	|| echo "$u (currently not installed)"; done

Then run

$ fbsetbg -u xv -f $MYWALLPAPER.jpg

but use the wallpaper setter chosen rather than "xv" in that command.

From now on

$ fbsetbg -l

will load that same wallpaper, and fluxbox will do that when it starts.
